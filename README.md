# CRAB Data Analysis

## Problem Statement

To compare the data gathered by BU Spark from Massachusetts Central Register, with the
stateâ€™s databases of minority-owned and women-owned businesses, to look for patterns in the
procurement database that may indicate the imbalance in participation by minority and
women-owned businesses, as well as the disparity in the number of RFPs and the awards.

## Datasets

We basically have 2 sources of data-  

1. From BU-Spark! - [http://necirspark.herokuapp.com]  
This data consists of all the contracts by the State and the businesses that they were
awarded to. We can analyze the disparity between the number of RFPs and the awards
from this database.

2. From [https://www.sdo.osd.state.ma.us/BusinessDirectory/BusinessDirectoryDownload.aspx]:  
  a. SDO (MBE, WBE, PBE and NPO) Directory Listing by Business Name  
  b. DBE Directory Listing by Business Name  
  c. ACDBE Directory Listing by Business Name  
This data consists of information about all the minority and women-owned businesses in
the state. We can compare this data with the contracts and their awards from the
previous dataset to analyze the participation of minority and women-owned businesses.
